# Steam Achievement Manager Auto but with minor improvements
- Forked from [SAM Auto release](https://github.com/FarukGamer/SteamAchievementManager-Auto/releases/latest).
- This code is based on the Upstream PR in https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager/pull/62


## What's new
- A new "Unlock All" feature has been added that loops through all of the displayed games and unlocks everything automatically.
- Unlock All no ALT TAB you to your desktop while playing a full screen game
- Game Window is not shown in taskbar
- Game window will start minimized while picker window stay unchanged
- Less goofy default size for picker
## Will I get banned for using the "Unlock All" feature?

"I ran it on over 3600 games with achievements, yet no community ban or sanction toward the account.", 6_6_7
"Honestly, I'm not really sure. I doubt it's any worse than just using this program normally. I let it run through 460+ games and I'm doing fine. Please don't hold me or the original author responsible for any damages this could cause.", FarukGamer
