# Steam Achievement Manager Auto

This code is based on the Upstream PR in https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager/pull/62

[Download latest SAM Auto release](https://github.com/FarukGamer/SteamAchievementManager-Auto/releases/latest).

## What's new
- A new "Unlock All" feature has been added that loops through all of the displayed games and unlocks everything automatically.

## Will I get banned for using the "Unlock All" feature?
Honestly, I'm not really sure. I doubt it's any worse than just using this program normally. I let it run through 460+ games and I'm doing fine. Please don't hold me or the original author responsible for any damages this could cause.
